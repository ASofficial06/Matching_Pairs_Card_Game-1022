# Matching Pairs Card Game üÉè

### Name of the Team: J.A.K.R

### Title of the Project: Matching Pairs Game

### Project Description: 

This project will be a shape based memory game. Each shape will have a different color card associated with it. The cards will be displayed on screen face down then when selected a card would flip. Once you match all the cards associated with the shape the cards will flip back down and you will have cleared the sequence. The sequences will be randomly generated and get increasingly difficult.The score you achieve will be based on the number of sequences you get correct. The goal is to get the highest possible score which will be stored on the leaderboard. Once you fail to clear a sequence you lose and the game will reset.

### Functional Requirements Draft:

- Welcome screen that shows different options of game modes.
- Allows users to input username. 
- Game should generate random sequences. The random sequence of cards will not be shown to the user. 
- Players should be able to interact with shapes and pick the sequence, able to flip 2 cards at a time.
- If a player gets a sequence right (matches a pair),there will be a sound to indicate the sequence has been cleared. 
- There will be a sound and visual effect to indicate if you have not cleared the sequence. 
- Background music throughout the game.
- Stopwatch to record the length of time necessary to complete a sequence.
- Increasing difficulty, the sequence length increases. 
- The game will store the score and the amount of time you have been playing the games. This will then be added to the high scores in the leaderboards. 
- Multiple leaderboards for different game modes. 
- Bonus cards that have effects like adding time or removing some of it,  there will even be cards that if flipped end the game. 
- How to play, an icon that tells the user the rules and how to play the game. 

#### Game Mode Ideas:
- Three Lives Matching Pairs Gamemode.
- Timed Matching Pairs Gamemode.
    - Timed gamemode: There is a time limit at the top of the screen and 8 cards flipped down on the screen. The user has to match and complete a pair of cards/shapes in a curtain duration of time. The user will start off with X minutes‚Ä¶ Once all the cards on the screen have been paired together, the user will be rewarded with X seconds onto their existing timer and +1 to their score. Then, the game will generate 8 random new sequence of cards on screen and the game will continue. Once the timer runs out, the total number of the user‚Äôs score will be displayed on screen and added to the leader board
- Endless Matching Pairs Gamemode
- Card Rush Gamemode
